				the content and materials available on the Interface does not constitute
				any form of advice or recommendation by us, should not be regarded as an
				offer, solicitation, invitation or recommendation to buy or sell
				investments, securities or any other financial services and is not

			</Text>

			<Text>
				Any reference to any rewards on the Interface is are a forward-looking
				projection based on a good faith belief of how to reasonably project
				results over the relevant period, but such belief is subject to numerous
				assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract security
				risks and third-party actions) which could result in a materially
				different (lower or higher) token-denominated value.
			</Text>

			<Text>
				The rewards are not a promise, guarantee, or undertaking on the part of
				any person or group of persons, but depends entirely on the results of
				operation of smart contracts and other autonomous systems (including
				third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems
				after the time of your interaction.
			</Text>

			<Text>
				Even if the rewards are received as projected, you may still suffer a
				financial loss in fiat-denominated terms if the fiat-denominated value
				of the relevant tokens (your digital assets and any tokens allocated or
				distributed to you pursuant to the rewards) declines during the period.

				The Interface is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the

				Trading

				You agree and understand that: (a) all interactions, including but not
				limited to, trades, mints, burns, liquidity providings, staking,
				unstaking, and claiming rewards you submit through any of our App,
				Interface, Protocol, or Site are considered unsolicited, which means

			<Heading as='h5' size='sm' mb='-6'>
				No Fiduciary Duties
			</Heading>
			<Text>
				This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any
				fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you
				acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to
				you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or

			</Text>

			<Heading as='h5' size='sm' mb='-6'>
				Assumption of Risk
			</Heading>
			<Text>
				By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you understand
				the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
				blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the
				usage and intricacies of digital assets. You further understand that the
				markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors
				including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology,
				security, and regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of
				transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable
				and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge the
				risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while
				they are supplied to the Protocol. If you borrow digital assets from the
				Protocol, you will have to supply digital assets of your own as
				collateral. If your collateral declines in value such that it is no
				longer sufficient to secure the amount that you borrowed, others may
				interact with the Protocol to seize your collateral in a liquidation
				event. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of
				these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot
				be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
				accessing or using the Interface.
			</Text>

			<Text>
				We make no warranties as to the markets on which digital assets are
				transferred, purchased, or traded. You are solely responsible for
				determining what, if any, taxes apply to your digital asset
				transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that
				apply to your transactions.
			</Text>

			<Text>
				We do not store, send, or receive digital assets or funds. This is
				because digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record
				maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of digital assets
				occurs within the decentralized Protocol and Ethereum blockchain and not
				in the Interface. We cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify any
				transaction or transaction details. There are no warranties or
				guarantees that a transfer initiated via the Interface will successfully
				transfer title or right in any digital asset.
			</Text>

			<Text>
				Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for
				all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface and interacting
				with the Protocol.
			</Text>

			<Heading as='h5' size='sm' mb='-6'>
				Release of Claims
			</Heading>
			<Text>
				You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your
				access and use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol.
				You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability,
				claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating
				to your use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol. If
				you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of
				California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “[a] general release does
				not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
				or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
				release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected
				his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
			</Text>

			<Heading as='h5' size='sm' mb='-6'>
				Indemnity
			</Heading>
			<Text>
				You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
				officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
				subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
				liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use
				of the Interface; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this
				Agreement, the right of any third party, or any other applicable law,
				rule, or regulation; and (c) any other party’s access and use of the
				Interface with your assistance or using any device or account that you
				own or control.

			<Heading as='h5' size='sm' mb='-6'>
				Limitation of Liability
			</Heading>
			<Text>
				Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
				employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to
				you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or
				exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of
				profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out
				of or relating to any access or use of the Interface, nor will we be
				responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
				tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the
				information contained within it. We assume no liability or
				responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of
				content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
				whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Interface; (c)

				incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available through
				the Interface; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of
				any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers,
				directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries
				be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations,
				damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to
				us in exchange for access to and use of the Interface, or $100.00,
				whichever is greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of
				whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence,
				strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised
				of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow
				the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of
				certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers
				and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This
				limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by
				law.
