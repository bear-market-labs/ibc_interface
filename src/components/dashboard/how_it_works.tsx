				The inverse bonding curve (IBC) implementation mints assets that devalue
				as bought and appreciate as sold. Tokens minted via IBCs, ibAssets, are
				the first asset class in history to follow the exact inverse of regular
				market dynamics. Arbitrage forces ibAssets to devalue per every
				purchase, regardless of where the purchase was made (CEX, Uniswap, etc.
				).
